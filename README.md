I was able to find a good dataset State drug utilization data. This particular Data Set includes a good mix of categorical values as well as continuous values and serves as a useful example that is relatively easy to understand. 
Before I get started i need to do some minor cleanups. 
after clean up some data the final check I want to do is see what data types I have.
CONVERTED some column with Object data type to categorical variables.
please find all the work on attched link.
